# Slackhound

Slackhound is a command line tool for red and blue teams to quickly perform reconnaissance of a Slack workspace/organization. Slackhound makes collection of an organization's users, files, messages, etc. quickly searchable and large objects are written to CSV for offline review.

# Requirements
You will need a Slack token for your target workspace with basic "user" level rights. Admin tokens are not required for Slackhound. As a red teamer I can normally find a token somewhere on the network. As a blue teamer, you can ask IT or responsible Slack team to generate a token for you. The other traditional option is to create a Slack app for the workspace and generate a token.
